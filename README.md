# ML-Census-Data

## Project Tasks

### a) Data Exploration
Loaded and explored the dataset.
Conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand the data.
Identified any patterns, outliers, or anomalies in the dataset.
Explored the distribution of features and the target variable.
Documented observations, including interesting insights gained from the exploratory analysis.

### b) Handling Categorical Data
Preprocessed the categorical data in the dataset.
Applied techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert categorical attributes into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Ensured that the data was properly prepared for the modelling stage.

### c) Machine Learning Models

#### Logistic Regression:
Employed logistic regression to predict whether an individual earned more than Â£50,000 annually.
Recognised its suitability for binary classification tasks and its ability to provide insights into the relationships between input features and the binary outcome.

#### Random Forest Classification:
Used random forest for classification to predict income levels while considering feature importance derived from the ensemble of decision trees.

#### Applied Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Employed the SVM algorithm to create a decision boundary that separated individuals into two income categories based on provided features.

#### K-Means Clustering:
Explored the application of K-Means clustering for grouping individuals into clusters based on feature similarity, even though it's not commonly used for classification.

#### Neural Network:
Employed a deep neural network for complex pattern recognition in the classification task due to its ability to capture intricate relationships between features and the target variable.

### d) Model Optimisation and Evaluation
Optimised the selected models to enhance their performance:
Performed hyperparameter tuning to find the best settings for each model.
Considered feature selection to identify the most relevant features.
Evaluated the models using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess their performance. Metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Compared the results of the models and discussed:
The extent to which optimisation improved each model's performance.
Provided explanations for the parameters used in the optimisation.
Compared the performances of multiple models of the same type (e.g., two classification models) to identify which one was more effective in predicting income levels.

### e) Conclusion
Summarised the findings and results from the project.
Provided overall conclusions, insights, and recommendations:
Reflected on the performance of the models in predicting income levels.
Discussed any assumptions made during the modelling process and their impact.
Suggested further steps or areas of improvement for future work in this domain.
